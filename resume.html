                   I am a highly motivated and passionate Software Engineering student with a strong foundation in programming and development. Over the past few years, I have specialized in C++, Java, and full-stack web development, gaining hands-on experience by working on diverse academic and personal projects. Notable among these are MediQuerii, a healthcare-focused platform, and Green Growth, a sustainability-driven initiative, both of which helped me strengthen my problem-solving and application design skills.
                   I take pride in building user-friendly interfaces, writing efficient and maintainable code, and developing scalable applications that solve real-world problems. My technical interests extend beyond conventional software engineering into machine learning, cloud computing, and modern frameworks, areas I am actively exploring to broaden my expertise and stay aligned with current industry trends.
                   strongly believe that technology has the power to transform lives, and my long-term goal is to create innovative, impactful solutions that not only enhance efficiency but also address challenges that matter to people and society. With every project I undertake, I focus on combining creativity, technical knowledge, and practical application to bridge the gap between technology and real-world needs.
